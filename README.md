# DSO
DSO design for ESD

Specs:
1. Clearance between tracks will be a minimum of 10mil

2. Vias and Through Holes will conform to manufacturer’s specifications

3. There will be four 3mm mounting screws 4mm from each edge at each corner and
these will be represented on the schematics as Non-BOM components. These holes
are for pick and place machinery and are standard for large scale manufacture

4. Your student number will be placed on the top right of your PCB and a schematic
symbol will represent the student number decal as a Non-BOM component.
Your name as it appears on the class list will be placed on the top left of your PCB

5. LEDs: A LED for +5 power good
	A LED for -5 power good
	LEDs for USB RX and TX
	LEDs should be labelled indicating their purpose

6. There will be only 2 designator orientations throughout your PCB design

7. All via’s should be tented on both Top and Bottom layers

8. USB differential lines must be laid out as a differential pair

9. All input and output connections must be clearly labelled

10. The top and bottom layers shall have a ground plain polygon pour

11. Tracks, components, and polygon pours, with the exception of the USB connector,
will be kept a bare minimum of 50 mil from the boards edge.

12. The correct layer stack configuration for a 2-layer PCB must be set for a total PCB
thickness of 1.6mm including the solder mask.

13. 2 PCB fiducials positioned close to one corner of the CPLD and microcontroller, and
represented on the schematics as non-BOM components. Fiducials are used by pick
and place machinery with computer vision to align components with good precision
and accuracy
